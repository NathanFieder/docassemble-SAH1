  Unfortunately you are not eligible to receive our support.
  
  The Aborgional Legal Rights Movement can only support clients that identify as an Aborgional or Torress Strait Islander person.
  However, we hope these legal services may be able to assit you:
  
   1. Legal Services Commission of SA (LSC) provides legal services for people who can't afford to pay for legal representation.
    
        Phone: 1300 366 424
    
   2. Community Justice Services provide legal advice, assistance and referral to community members who might not otherwise get the help  they need. Most centres provide services free of charge.
    
   3. Uniting Communities provides information, advice and     representation on social security matters, including Centrelink and   appeals in the Administrative Appeal Tribunal. This service is available to people on a government benefit, living in South Australia, and aged 15 and over.
   
       Phone: 8342 1800
  
  4. Women's Legal Service is a community-based legal centre that   provides free and confidential legal services to women in SA.
